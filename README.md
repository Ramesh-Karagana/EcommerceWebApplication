# E-Commerce Web App

This is the web application for e-commerce that will have a super user side, product seller side and a user side. The super user will be able to confirm the product seller when they registered in the system and also be able to design the user and product seller sides' pages in terms of carousel image or so on . Furthermore, the super user will decide the category and subcategories that product seller side will sell their products in that categories. That's to say, product seller will not be able to create a new category or subcategory. They just can choose the categories that their products are related with. So, product seller can add their products to system with some information such as productsâ€™ name, brand, cost and features of products. As you can guess, the user side will be able to choose product, add it to cart, list the products that are in the same subcategory in terms of the feature etc.
